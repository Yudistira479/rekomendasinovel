The invincible genius Reinhard von Lohengramm is matched only by the unbeatable magician Yang Wen-li; though the two share a profound respect for each other, they meet on the battlefield not as comrades but as bitter adversaries.

She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is.

A year later, Huntis has been held back a year, his old squad is gone, and he's been made the leader of a squad of troublemakers known as The Worsts, with Huntis himself no longer having the desire or motivation to accomplish anything.

The bright, talented, and attractive Ushio seems to have everything Sakuma lacks, and his academics and athletic prowess make him popular with the girls at school. Past trauma—and an understandable inferiority complex—slowly drive the two apart, and by the time they enter high school, they hardly even speak anymore. Thus, Sakuma finds himself alone. Against all odds, he eventually gains a friend in Natsuki, the sweetest girl in class. The two hit it off gushing about their favorite novels, and he falls head over heels for her. But that very same night, he stumbles upon an unexpected sight while walking through a familiar park: his old friend Ushio, dressed in a full-blown schoolgirl's uniform and sobbing uncontrollably.

Shun, a shy transfer student at the local middle school, is a lonely kid who spends his time making a freeware game. He ends up at the Jailhouse after being bullied by a popular and seemingly nice student named Takurou whose father owns the building. As he enters the mansion with Takurou, Shun is joined by his friends, the brainy Hiroshi and Anna, the kindhearted class president. Takurou's lackey, Takeshi, and Takurou's girlfriend Mika also accompany them. But once inside, they are unable to leave, and they come face to face with the blue monsters inhabiting the Jailhouse. But even stranger is the fact that their experiences in the mansion play out just like Shun's game.

In the span of two generations the town was built up to the status of prestige it now commands, an expansion helmed by the Hadou Group, an industrial complex and family dynasty currently run by the young Hadou Ruri. She pursues the peace and prosperity of Arkham diligently, against the forces of darkness threatening to plunge the city, and the world, back into a second dark age. Among the most sinister threats to Arkham City is the evil Black Lodge syndicate. Led by the charismatic Master Therion, his nihilistic outlook shapes the group's destructive goals: with a circle of powerful sorcerers at his command, the potential for sowing chaos in the city is unmatched. Former Miskatonic University Magic Academy student Daijuuji Kurou knows little of grimoires, but what he does know terrifies him - enough that he left his university life behind, and now practices a failing detective business in the shelter of an orphanage in a quiet corner of Arkham. But just when he thought his Academy past was buried, it catches up with him and pulls him back into the dark shadows of the occult: Hadou Ruri herself appears at his door with an offer he can't refuse. The only way to combat the Black Lodge's growing magical power is to find, and retrieve, a grimoire with the power to activate the mightiest Machina of all: Demonbane. The quest to find this forbidden tome will change Kurou's destiny... forever.

For the longest time, he's wandered alone across the deserted landscape, clinging to the hope that something—or someone—might be out there in the emptiness. When he finally stumbles across that someone, even more threads of color start to seep into the ashen world around them. This time, when Keisuke sets off down the road, someone sits beside him in the passenger seat. The first acquaintance he's ever made here, his first companion in this barren world. They're both traveling in search of something, and after searching alone for so long, maybe they'll have better luck working together? Their only lead is a witch who can answer any question—for a price. What will the two ask her, and what will she be able to tell them? More importantly, what will it cost them, and will they be willing to pay the price?

The Prince sees the grim state of the dried-up town and report on it, but Arshtat scorns this; she declares that Lordlake's citizens deserve their desolation for stealing the Dawn Rune. Arshtat's husband Ferid pulls her back to her senses, and she dismisses the inspection party with a whisper. The next issue of contention is the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held somewhat early for the ten-year old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing themselves with a champion, hail from rival noble houses: The foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fiance, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified. However, Lord Marscal Godwin, Gizel's father, is less than impressed with Gizel's activities, thinking that he has made an enemy of the Prince and the royal family as a whole with his plotting. Additionally, the royal family took Zegai, the Barows champion, into their own personal custody, who could perhaps help reveal the Godwins cheating and offer an excuse to annul the engagement. Thus, the Godwins launch a preemptive attack at the engagement ceremony in Sol-Falena, Falena's capital. Arshtat and Ferid had anticipated and prepared for the attack, but not the involvement of the elite Nether Gate assassins, who overwhelm the palace's defenses. The struggle culminates in Arshtat and Ferid's deaths, while Lymsleia finds herself a captive.

He wasn't like that when he was little, but changed with adulthood. As soon as someone around him was showing too much interest toward him, trying to pray into his past, he would immediately change his address and work in order to reset everything. And above all, he used to keep his mouth shut about that little something he was able to do, and that no one else around could. Not that anyone would believe him anyway. It would just make others ostracize him for being creepy. Because Takumi can see ghosts, and freely talk with them as well. Forget about the misconception that ghost are full of hatred or other ill feelings. They aren't. They're actually often nicer than they were while they were still alive, as if dying and being liberated from their body washed away that kind of things, only leaving some lingering feelings stopping them from moving on. But isolating himself from others is no longer an option. Takumi is now a new employee in a company where everyone is like him. They use that little something others don't have to work for insurance companies and police behind the scenes, asking the ghost directly for the circumstances of their death, unofficially leading the cases toward their rightful conclusion. And also, part of the pride of this job is to help those ghosts to pass on after they completed the insurance company or police request. As a new employee, Takumi will have to learn from his seniors how to understand them, and deal with their lingering feelings, one way or another. But can someone who rejected others for all those years really understand how they feel?",Light Novel,,Odou Akihiko,"Drama,Supernatural",,Publishing,,,52842,0,2013.0,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/134809.jpg

Years ago, when the Saint's prayer was interrupted, an incident known as the ""Gran Forte"" occurred, causing a portion of the land to fall and split the lower city into two, separated by a cliff. Countless lives and property were lost or irreversibly affected in what would be known as the greatest disaster in the city's history. In time, the lowest layer, known as the ""Prison,"" became the home to people who lost much of their former lives during the ""Gran Forte."" Crime, famine, and disease run rampant, with ""The Noncorroding Gold Chains,"" the ruling organization in the area specializing in the sex trade, keeping what little order that still exists. Meanwhile, a contagious disease which causes the infected to grow wings has spread throughout the city, and a unit commonly known as the ""Wing Hunters"" has been formed to deal with these people swiftly and often violently. In this ""Prison"" resides Caim Astraea, a freelance ex-assassin who does odd jobs for his friend, the head of ""The Noncorroding Gold Chains,"" for money. During one request, Caim finds Eustia, a winged girl who emits the pale purple light characteristic of the ""Gran Forte"" incident years ago. His encounter with Eustia will take him on a journey which will involve him with the most influential bodies of the city, including the Church and the royal government. As he searches for the meaning to his cruel, difficult life, he will discover the deepest and darkest secrets of Novus Aether...

At our last cultural festival, we had our live concert and spent the last moments of the festival together--After that, Rin died. In her final moments, I told to her 'I like you' --I told her the message that I should have never conveyed. When I arrived at the her hospital room, I received a slip of paper with only the words 'I'm sorry'. I shouldn't have told those feelings. Someone like me shouldn't have gotten close to Rin. Then, I experienced a time leap. At the riverside where we first met, I met her once more, the Rin who I always wanted to see again, to see that radiant simile once more... That's why this time I won't make the same mistake. Because I definitely cannot convey these feelings. I decided that to the very end, I must repress my own feelings.

As people began moving from Europe to the New World in the latter half of the fifteenth century, the non-humans took over England. In order to create a safe haven for them, the gods and demons that left them there cut England away from reality and sealed it inside of a book. The various species that once existed tangibly are now in the fictional England, therefore making them ""fictional"" beings. As a book, England has a cover known as Heaven and a back cover known as Hell. Between those are nine chapter title pages, the same number as there are orders of angels. From the moment you set foot in that foreign land, your form and emotions are expressed in writing. Humans rarely have a chance to enter that space. In that same city, three humans—Valeath, Ralf, and Moyla—invade. The demons are killed one-by-one, their voices beginning to be extinguished. Amon, a young man belonging to the demon tribe; Klausl, a blind young girl; Firius, a catgirl; and an unidentified man named Captain all take a stand to save the ones they hold dear. Amidst the fierce battle between humanity and demonkind, the true purpose of three humans will finally be revealed! Will the demons be able to stop the humans' conspiracy?

The civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, as well as the Moon Crystals that could be used to control them. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, which caused enormous environmental harm and threatened the extinction of all six civilizations. The most advanced of the civilizations, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroying the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent the Rains from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away. In present time, the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire, led by Empress Teodora, seeks the Moon Crystals in order to awaken the Gigas and take over the world. Valua's will is enforced through the Valuan Armada, a fleet of iron-clad warships led by senior admiral Galcian and vice admiral Ramirez under the authority of the Empress.

To improve their chances of winning, Metatron creates a memory clone of the legendary Char Aznable. Char Afranche, aged 19 years, assumes command of Metatron and pilots the Gaia Gear Alpha after learning the truth of his origins. Gundam Gaia Gear was written by Tomino Yoshiyuki and features mechanical designs [mostly] by Ito Mamoru. Gaia Gear was Tomino's first attempt to portray the 3rd century of the UC universe. Later works by Studio Sunrise have invalidated Gaia Gear and it is now considered a UC side story (when it's remembered at all). Ito's mechanical designs are innovative and hearken back to the days before the ""Gundam Look"" was set in stone. Gundam Gaia Gear first appeared as a serial in the Japanese edition of Newtype Magazine (from April 1987 to December 1991). The story was then collected in five novels that ran from September 1988 to April 1992. It was also a radio drama that was collected on 5 CD's (the first released in November 1992 and the final in July 1993). Two soundtrack CD's accompanied the radio drama.

The city of San-Teresa became a home for over two million of these otherworldly visitors. Unfortunately, the population boom also brought its fair share of problems—drugs, prostitution, and trafficking. To combat the rampant crime lurking in the city's shadows, a new department was established in the San-Teresa Metropolitan Police. Former JSDF soldier Kei Matoba is one of the best cops that the department has to offer, despite his inclination to occasionally bend the rules. After a fairy trafficking case goes wrong, Kei loses Rick Fury, his friend and partner of four years, setting him on a quest for vengeance. To help him with the case, the department pairs him with Tilarna Exedilika, a noble of the Farbani Kingdom. As one of the Knights of Mirvor, her duty is to rescue the noble fairy that Kei encountered during his last case. Despite his distaste for non-humans, he accepts the arrangement at the request of his superiors. Now, the unlikely duo must come together and overcome their differences in order to return the missing fairy to her country and avenge the death of Kei's partner.

There are two types of Kung Fu masters, those who mastered their internal qi, and those who mastered their physical skills. The qi masters are able to output a stronger energy coming from their life itself, but it took a long time to master it. It was easier to just train their physical skills, but there was a limit to how strong a human body can be. So there were a balance of many average physical skill masters and few strong qi masters. However that balance broke when cybernetics came into play. Kung Fu masters would replace their body with robotic parts and attain a strength that a normal human can never achieve. That's how no one tried to become qi masters anymore when they can easily become powerful by using cybernetics, and qi masters decreased in numbers. The main character of the story Kong Taoluo, a qi master, used to be the top assassin of the leading mafia group. He was betrayed and killed, or at least he was supposed to be, but now he returns to city of Shanghai for revenge and for his sister...

Little Nina, after spending years being forced to use her magic to power a tank used to fight these rogue tanks, has become homeless and starving. When she attempts to steal food, she runs into a group of girls that are driving their own tank. Rather than hurt her, they take her into their home. The group of girls comprise a private tank squad, called ""Rabbits,"" which fights to defend their town from rampaging rogue tanks. After taking so much abuse in the past, Nina is understandably skeptical of the kindness the ""Rabbits"" show her, but she soon realizes that they can actually be trusted. Nina becomes the newest member of the Rabbits tank squad, dedicated to using her strength to protect others!
